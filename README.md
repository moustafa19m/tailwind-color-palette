# Tailwind Colors Palette

Tailwind colors come with tailwind install, but there are cases where you can't install tailwind directly such as in react native apps. This package copies all the tailwind colors and wraps them for you to call them easily with the custom values of tailwind.

## Getting Started

To install 
```
npm install tailwind-color-palette
```

Usage
```
import {Stale} from 'tailwind-color-palette';

console.log(Stale[200])  //"#e2e8f0"
```



For a full list of colors, please check the official Tailwind color list: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors

All these colors are included in this package.
